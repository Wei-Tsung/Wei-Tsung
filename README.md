### Hi there friends, I am OceanðŸ‘‹
**I am a data scientist professional based in Taiwan âœ¨ âœ¨ 
Here is my way of 

I know this sounds a little bit offensive and rebell for many professors and recruiters.
but I think

There are tons and tons of garbage codes being uploaded or I shall say dumped into github everyday, and minutes.

These code is not elegant, 

These people are not doing it out of their own consciensness, but rather doing it out of fears and forced by social pressures.
They are doing it because the universities love to see it, the recruiters love to see it, although this behaviors are meaningless most of the time.

As a matter of truth, Github is not a place for general people keep uploading their homeworks and projects.
but a open-source platform encourages people to share their great invention, unique discoveries, or innovative ideas even elegant pieces of code.

Many lousy professors mistaken it, so they asked all of students to upload their weekly homeworks and projects on github, creating lots of noises on the repo.

This is a tragedy for this outstanding platform that is being misused, and this is definitely not the original intention of the creators of this platform.


I will definitely avoid this path that many other people are taking.

I'll stick to the principle of Occam's Razor : Less is more.
If I really find some data science projects very innovative or interesting, provided time allow, I will upload to the github, otherwise I won't do that .

If I find something interesting, but the contents are not mature enough
I will strictly keep the content private only to myself.
